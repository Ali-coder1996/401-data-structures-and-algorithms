# Singly Linked List

Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

## Challenge

**create singly LinkedList and implement some method like insert and include and toString** 

## Approach & Efficiency

**insert:** bigO(1)
**include:** bigO(n),because we use While loop
**toString:** bigO(n),because we use While loop

## API

`insert` insert the data and check if Linked List have head or not, in this method it will not
return anything, it is a public method.

`includes` search reserve value and check of the Linked List has a size it will search at each data
in Linked List, in this method it will return true or false, it is a public method.

`toString` build in method to print the data in class
